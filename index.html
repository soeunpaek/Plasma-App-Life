            <strong><u>Title: Plasma Treatment Green Industry for citizens of Industrial city in a 4IR</u></strong> <br><br>
            Since the Industrial Revolution, various environmental pollution problems have occurred due to the development and use of resources.<br>
            Especially in industrial cities, already the environment exceeded the natural purification capacity occurring various diseases with the ecosystem being destroyed.<br>
            In this sense focus on increasing the regeneration capacity for the ecosystem restoration of industrial cities.<br>
            <U>How can make a green treatment so that citizens could safely breathe and healthily live in an industrial city of multi-crisis (climate change, industrial-pollutions, and pandemic) in a 4IR era?</U><br>
            <strong>The Smart Plasma Plants RE100 (SPPR)</strong> combines InfoTech and Biotech based on renewable energy.<br>
            SPPR supports climate systems as they systemically transform themselves to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM).<br>
            The AI auto-sensor system produces optimally treated species that transforms atmospheric (real) substance as data.<br>
            The (Cold) Plasma plays a role in anti-infection the treatment solution to industrial pollutants compounds with the variant’s viruses.<br>
            Plants by photosynthesis (chemical process) consume CO2 and produce O2 that humans need to breathe a sustainable circular system process for the essential vital source for the life.<br>
            All processes operate by the 100% renewable energy system that adapts to Net-Zero action as an alternative energy system for the mitigation of CO2 by fossil fuels that protects against global warming.<br>
            The enterprise and government for desirable industry must respond to industrial crisis (the treatment of pollution) for safe & healthy citizens (humans) in industrial cities (environment).<br>
            The industrial city's citizens have the right to have clean environmental rights.<br>
            SPPR is a win-win industrial city project for the citizens of the industrial city.
